Count Down Timer
=======

Count Down Timer helps the users to display the count down timer and displays the desire content when the time count downs to zero.

**Check out [demo](https://jsfiddle.net/0Lo7dsqb/2/)**

Try changing the date in 

      <div data-count-down-time=""></div>

## How it works
-Give the data attribute count-down-time to a container in html file where you want to use the timer.
-Give the end time to the count-down-time data attribute as shown in the demo.html
-Change the content after the count down goes to 0

## Todo
